# Trade Bot Evaluation Station
## Overview
In the fast-paced world of financial markets, volatility presents both opportunities and risks for traders. 
To capitalize on market fluctuations, automated trading systems, or trade bots, have become increasingly popular. 
These bots execute trades based on pre-programmed criteria, but their effectiveness depends on accurate 
performance evaluation. This project focuses on analyzing a trade botâ€™s performance over a span of four years, 
offering insights into profitability, risk management, and decision-making efficiency. By using key financial 
metrics and interactive tools, this application aims to help traders, analysts, and researchers refine their 
trading strategies and maximize returns.

### Get your Trade Bot Evaluated on filtered dates
Easily assess your trade bot's performance using key financial metrics like Profit Factor, Win Rate, Average 
Trade Profit, Max Drawdown, and Expectancy. These metrics offer a clear understanding of your bot's efficiency, 
profitability, and risk exposure, helping you make data-driven adjustments to improve its performance.

### Get a week's forecast of trade price
Use the built-in ARIMA model to forecast trade prices for the upcoming week. This feature provides valuable 
insights into future market trends, enabling you to fine-tune your trading strategies based on predicted price 
movements.

### Get Gemini's opinion

improvement, and offers recommendations for optimizing your trading tactics. Let Gemini guide you toward 
smarter, more profitable trading decisions.
